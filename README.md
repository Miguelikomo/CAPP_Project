# CAPP_Project
#The app would take responses from a user, 
and based on these responses, it would recommend 
the proper course of action to take  

The tools you need for this projects are as follow:

-an IDE (here we used Visual studio code to implement) and you are welcome to use the one you are familiar with
-an Python framework ( we used Bottle, a python framework)and again, you can use any other framework
-an Command promt to run the code.
